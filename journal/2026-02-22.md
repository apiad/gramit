# Journal - 2026-02-22

- Initialized the project and set up the `GEMINI.md` guidelines.
- Created the `CHANGELOG.md` and the `journal/` directory.
- Read and analyzed the initial `DESIGN.md` to understand the project goals.
- Critically evaluated the v1 design, identifying significant flaws in TUI handling, security, and dependencies.
- Updated `DESIGN.md` to include the identified issues as a list of open questions.
- Researched best practices for pseudo-terminals, TUI screen scraping, and Telegram bot security.
- Formulated a new, more robust v2 architecture.
- Updated `DESIGN.md` to reflect the v2 architecture, which removes the `tmux` dependency, introduces a proper security model, and uses a virtual terminal screen for TUI handling.
- Refined the TUI handling requirements to focus on extracting semantic content rather than raw screen dumps.
- Updated `DESIGN.md` to v2.1, adding a "Heuristic Filtering" step to the TUI processing pipeline.
- Created a comprehensive `ROADMAP.md` detailing the full implementation plan, including phases for scaffolding, component development, testing, and documentation.
