# Journal - 2026-02-23

- Retroactively documented the completion of Phase 1 (Project Scaffolding) which was done in a previous session.
- Marked all Phase 1 tasks in `ROADMAP.md` as complete.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` under the `[Unreleased]` section to reflect the initial project setup.
- This brings the project documentation in sync with the actual state of the repository.

### Phase 1 Implementation Details

- **Project Initialization**: The project was initialized using `uv`, creating the virtual environment and `pyproject.toml`.
- **Directory Structure**: Created `src/gramit` for the main application source and `tests/` for testing.
- **Dependencies Added**:
    - Main dependencies (`uv add`): `pyte>=0.8.2`, `python-dotenv>=1.2.1`, `python-telegram-bot>=22.6`.
    - Development dependencies (`uv add --dev`): `pytest>=9.0.2`, `pytest-asyncio>=1.3.0`.
- **Core Files Created**: The initial set of empty Python modules were created in `src/gramit/`:
    - `__init__.py`
    - `cli.py`
    - `filters.py`
    - `orchestrator.py`
    - `router.py`
    - `telegram.py`
- **Test Configuration**: Configured `pytest` in `pyproject.toml` to use `tests` as the test path and set `asyncio_mode` to `auto`.
