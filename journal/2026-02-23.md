## 2026-02-23: Mirror Mode, TUI Stability Fixes, and Gemini Logger

## Status
- [x] Reproduced `TypeError` in `OutputRouter` when handling PTY bytes.
- [x] Fixed `bytes` vs `str` handling in `OutputRouter._handle_new_data`.
- [x] Optimized local input reading to handle chunks (improving TUI responsiveness).
- [x] Increased mirror debounce to 40ms to mitigate flickering.
- [x] Made terminal preparation/restoration more robust against non-TTY environments.
- [x] Verified with unit tests and regression tests.
- [x] Fixed PTY/TUI output leaking to Telegram in `--output-stream` mode.
- [x] Performed final code review and minor cleanups.
- [x] Synchronized `__version__` in `src/gramit/__init__.py` to `0.4.6`.
- [x] Deleted empty and unused `src/gramit/filters.py`.
- [x] **New:** Fixed multiple formatting and chunking bugs in `.gemini/hooks/gemini_logger.py`.
- [x] **New:** Verified hook fixes with a new suite of unit tests.

## Observations
- The `_handle_new_data` method was routing everything to both the Mirror and Telegram buffers.
- When `--output-stream` is used, the PTY drainer must only update the Mirror buffer, while the File Tailer must only update the Telegram buffer.
- Reading local stdin one byte at a time was a major bottleneck for TUI applications, especially when mouse tracking was enabled.
- Mixing `sys.stdout.write` (buffered) with `os.write` (unbuffered) in the same terminal session was likely contributing to inconsistent rendering and flickering.
- Version mismatch between `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py` was corrected.
- Redundant "New" comments and unused files were cleaned up for final release.

## Changes
- **src/gramit/router.py**:
    - Changed `_mirror_buffer` to `bytes`.
    - Updated `_handle_new_data` to handle both `str` and `bytes` inputs.
    - Optimized `_handle_local_input` to read up to 4096 bytes at once.
    - Increased `_mirror_debounce_interval` to 40ms.
    - Updated `_prepare_terminal` and `_restore_terminal` to use `os.write` and handle `io.UnsupportedOperation`.
- **src/gramit/__init__.py**: Bumped version to `0.4.5`.
- **src/gramit/telegram.py**: Removed redundant comments and fixed messy imports.
- **src/gramit/cli.py**: Removed redundant comments and simplified shutdown logic documentation.
- **src/gramit/filters.py**: Removed (unused/empty).
- **tests/test_orchestrator.py**: Updated to expect `bytes` from `read()`.
- **tests/test_router_mirror_bytes.py**: Added reproduction test case.
