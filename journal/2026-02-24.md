## Status
- Updated `README.md` with a comprehensive "Magical Use Cases" section covering remote VPS management, AI agent monitoring, and Obsidian integration.
- Added PyPI version and download count badges to the top of the `README.md` file.
- Conducted a comprehensive security and performance audit of the codebase, identifying critical vulnerabilities like environment variable leaks and input sanitization risks alongside performance bottlenecks such as polling overhead and task churn.
- Summarized the completed security and performance improvements, including environment scrubbing, input sanitization, and PTY monitoring optimizations, and confirmed system stability with a passing test suite.
- Fixed a regression where PTY data leaked into Telegram by correctly flagging it as mirror-only when an output stream is active, verified with a new reproduction test.
- Fixed a syntax error in the router tests, verified the final terminal restoration implementation with the test suite, and removed the temporary reproduction script.
- Added a test comment to `src/gramit/cli.py` and enabled the `AfterAgent` hook for automated journal/changelog tracking.
- Implemented the `/commit` custom command in `GEMINI.md` to automate intelligent grouping and committing of changes using Conventional Commits format.
- Refined and enabled the `AfterAgent` hook in `.gemini/hooks/gemini_logger.py` to ensure automated record-keeping for significant changes.
