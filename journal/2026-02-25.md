- Implemented a `SessionStart` welcome message hook with project info, git status, and command list.
- **Maintenance:** Refactored terminal management into `TerminalManager`, modularized `cli.py` into `GramitCLI`, and enhanced documentation and test coverage across the project.
- Fixed a typo in the `makefile` (`un run` -> `uv run`).
